## üéì Project Context & Motivation

This project, **"Medieval Village Prototype,"** is being developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the capstone assignment for **Module 4: Greyboxing in Unreal Engine** of the **[Fundamentals of Level Design with Unreal Engine](https://www.coursera.org/learn/level-design?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This is the third course in the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

To accelerate development and focus on level design, this project leverages core assets: the **Official UE Animation Sample Project** for advanced third-person character locomotion and the **SuperGrid Starter Pack** for rapid prototyping materials and meshes.

The primary goal is to translate the conceptual design from its Level Design Document (LDD) into a playable **single-player open-world style medieval village greybox** within Unreal Engine 5.5.1. The focus is on core level design principles: spatial layout, player flow, establishing zones (castle, village, farms), interactive elements, and prototyping opportunities for stealth and exploration, all before artistic detailing. This repository documents the development process of the Medieval Village level.

## üéØ Overview

**Medieval Village Prototype** is an in-progress single-player level being greyboxed in **Unreal Engine 5.5.1**. It aims to create a small, explorable open-world environment featuring a central castle, an adjacent village with various functional buildings (homes, smithy, tavern, market), farming areas, and opportunities for player interaction.

Development utilizes a robust third-person character controller from the **UE Animation Sample Project** and **SuperGrid Starter Pack** assets for efficient blockout. The gameplay is envisioned in a **third-person perspective**, allowing players to roam freely, interact with (placeholder) NPCs for quests, and engage in stealth/thievery mechanics like lockpicking doors/chests and sneaking past guards. This greybox will focus on establishing the foundational layout, scale, traversal, and basic interactive elements described in the project's LDD.

## ‚ú® Key Goals & Features (Planned & In-Progress - Greybox Focus for the Village Level)

*   üß± **Effective Greyboxing with SuperGrid & Primitives:** Utilize SuperGrid assets and standard primitive shapes to create a clear and functional level layout for the castle, village, and farming areas.
*   üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Player Path & Flow (Leveraging Advanced Animation System):** Establish intuitive navigation through the village, castle, and surrounding areas, supported by the high-quality character controller from the UE Animation Sample.
*   üèûÔ∏è **Zone Definition:** Clearly define and block out key zones:
    *   **Castle Area:** Main castle, courtyards, surrounding structures.
    *   **Village Proper:** Residential homes, Smithy, Tavern, Market.
    *   **Farming Area:** Fields for diverse crops, animal husbandries (cow/pig farm).
*   üìê **Scale & Proportion:** Ensure all elements (buildings, paths, cover objects) are appropriately scaled for third-person gameplay.
*   üëÅÔ∏è **Sightlines & Composition:** Strategically plan sightlines for player guidance, exploration appeal, and potential stealth gameplay.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Gameplay Element Prototyping (Spatial):**
    *   Block out locations for (placeholder) NPCs and their workstations.
    *   Design building interiors with spaces for lootable chests and lockable doors.
    *   Incorporate environmental elements for stealth (bushes, dark areas, alleyways).
    *   Define guard patrol routes and posts.
*   üìÑ **LDD Adherence:** Translate the spatial and interactive concepts from the "Medieval Village Prototype" LDD into the 3D greybox.
*   üí° **Readability:** Use basic lighting and contrasting forms (SuperGrid materials assist here) to ensure the level is understandable and navigable.
*   üîÑ **Iterative Design & Playtesting:** Continuously playtest for flow, scale, navigation, and basic interaction functionality using the integrated character controller.
*   üì¶ **Course Submission Package:** Prepare all necessary materials for the Coursera module submission.

*(Functionality like AI, skill systems, and complex quests are part of the broader LDD vision; this greybox focuses on the spatial foundation and basic interactions).*
